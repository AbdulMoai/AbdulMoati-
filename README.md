About me
I am a person who has a father, that works as a doctor, and he was taking me to his job sometimes since I was young, as a result, this thing has affected me to be a doctor when I grow up.

My father was my hero, he suffered a lot to become a doctor, he was waking up at dawn to harvest some vegetables and then giving them to my grandmother to sell them and then going to the university to follow his dream.

He deserves every good thing in this life, and I am trying hard to make him proud of me, that is another reason that has pushed me to become a doctor, he was satisfied with that but he was telling me something all the time, which is “study and be whatever you want”, I did not understand that until I grew up.

While growing up, I was studying Biology and Architectural Engineering in high school.

I was good for both subjects, and I was studying hard for them, I was planning to study Biology in the university and get high at this subject.

In 2016 my father bought me a PS4, because of my final grade in school, I was so hyped about it and since then I became a gamer, every game I play I wonder how these things happened, such as graphics and the animations etc.

How can a human do that? I have been searching and found an article talking about game’s developers, and I started to search for that job because I loved games.

Two years later I bought a PC and the game is changed now, I know more about gaming and I started to learn about computers and Windows, so I was getting into it, I was playing a lot of games to have fun and understand more about this world. The dark side of that is not doing anything except gaming, as a result, I got fat and that affected me badly, so I started to take care of my body and gaming at the same time, but less time than before, so I started to go to the gym and read about diet and Bodybuilding, and it attracted me badly to be a personal trainer.

I was going deeper and deeper everyday through working out and learning about diet, so I decided to study fitness industry and become a personal trainer and nutritionist.

I was driven to the gym having an idea of being a personal trainer and I was saving money as much as a can to study abroad, and once I was ready to go and study, something happened to me that have killed my passion of nutrition and training, it was hard for me to leave something I was dreaming of everyday, but it’s life.

After that I came back to gaming to forget what happened to me, and from there I was thinking to become a developer, Maybe the destiny wants me to be this one instead of that, and I am ok with that because it is something that I am interested in.

I live in Canada now, People have been asking me to introduce myself and telling where am I from and why am I here, because of my different looking from them, I always say that my name is AbdulMoati, Israelian, 21 years old, student.

But few people asked me what am I going to study? Interesting question isn’t it?

I used to answer many other answers since I was young but when they ask me now, I will definitely answer Web Development, and they will feel glad to hear that because it is the future job to our world.

why did I choose to study Development?

I was going to my high-school wondering what I will study and work in the future, until my cousin has suddenly graduated from the collage studying coding, it was new for me hearing this kind of job, because in that time it was an uncommon thing in my country, as a result of that, the salaries were high and it is getting higher and higher, from that moment I looked forward to see what is that career, especially when I heard that it is connected to gaming world.

my country is kind of hard to live with an average salary, so I started to think that I have some back ground of computers because of gaming and the career brings money, so why not.

from there the development was an essential plan for me.

I have tried many careers to study, but in the end I was driven to coding.

I will start this journey learning in the collage and watching some videos about how to code and even try to discuss with experts of this career to get some advices to improve myself.

I am thinking of starting with back end and then learning front end to be a full stack so I can function more in this job.
